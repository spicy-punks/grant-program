### Overview

Spicy Punks is a restaurant based in Ludhiana, India which is focused on conducting the web3 meetups. Being Blockchain Maximalists we never found a space where we can interact with like-minded individuals, so we innovated the Spicy Punks to be a comfort for all our Web 3.0 fam. On a regular basis, we are conducting meetups so that all who share a similar vision in Ludhiana can discuss on the same platform

### Project Details

Spicy Punks is looking to organize community meet-ups which will help in educating users about the VeChain ecosystem along with spreading the awareness. We will be providing free food and drinks for all the attendees who will be coming. We will be integrating the NFTs as proof of attendance. A POAP NFT is a digital version of these mementos. POAP is an acronym for "Proof of Attendance Protocol”

We will be also using the VeChain tech to integrate the Phygital NFTs which will be integrated into the working. Anyone can buy these NFTs and redeem them for the actual food in the restaurant.

### Ecosystem Fit
No, there is no other project in a similar domain that is building on VeChain. We are looking to educate and spread awareness about the VeChain ecosystem through our community meet-ups.
